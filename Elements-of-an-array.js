/*4. Print the elements of an array

Given an array X = [1,4,2,12], write a program that will iterate through the array and print all numbers on the screen. Your program should work with arrays of all sizes.*/

//Pseudocode

//1. Loop to iterate over all the elements in the array

const x = [1, 4, 2, 12];
for (let i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {
  console.log(x[i]);
}

x = [1, 4, 2, 12], //the output will be:
//i*1 = 1

1
4
2
12
